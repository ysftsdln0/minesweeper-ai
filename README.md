# Minesweeper AI

A modern Minesweeper game with an intelligent AI solver built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Interactive Minesweeper game with customizable difficulty levels
- ðŸ¤– Advanced AI solver with multiple solving strategies
- ðŸŽ¯ Smart pattern recognition and probabilistic analysis
- ðŸ’¡ Step-by-step AI reasoning display
- ðŸ“± Responsive design with modern UI
- âš¡ Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

## AI Solving Strategies

The AI solver implements multiple sophisticated strategies:

1. **Basic Constraint Solving**: Analyzes revealed numbers and their neighbors
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Detects common Minesweeper patterns (1-2-1, etc.)
3. **Probabilistic Analysis**: Calculates mine probabilities for optimal guessing
4. **Smart Opening**: Uses statistically optimal starting positions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **AI Logic**: Custom TypeScript algorithms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minesweeper-ai.git
cd minesweeper-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Manual Play**: Click on cells to reveal them, right-click to flag mines
2. **AI Assistance**: Use the AI solver to get hints or watch it solve automatically
3. **Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert modes
4. **Custom Games**: Set your own board size and mine count

## AI Algorithm Details

The AI solver uses a multi-layered approach:

- **Certainty Analysis**: Identifies 100% safe moves first
- **Constraint Propagation**: Uses mathematical constraints from revealed numbers
- **Probability Calculation**: Computes mine likelihood for each unrevealed cell
- **Pattern Matching**: Recognizes and exploits common board patterns
